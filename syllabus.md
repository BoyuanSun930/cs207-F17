## Learning Objectives

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Use Python, including its advanced features to write scientific programs

* Understand what features of Python (or for that matter any programming language) make up its language 
  execution model and how these features impact the code you write: e.g. how modularity, abstraction, and 
  encapsulation can be used to solve problems

* Write these programs with good software engineering practices

* Code data management techniques to store data, staring from a good understanding of data structures.

* Combine these techniques together to write large pieces of software (you will do a group project for this), 
  working in a team of scientists, programmers, etc.

* Evaluate and test software to see which one your group ought to use. 

* Be a capable unicorn: able to contribute on both the science and software engineering sides of things.

* Hit the road running as a scientist. 

## Course Topics

## Lecture Attendance

Lecture attendance is mandatory and essential.  A large portion of lecture time will be spent writing programs and
working in groups.  In order to encourage participation, students will be required to present solutions to in-class 
exercises.

Attendance at guest lectures is mandatory and will be checked by passing around sign-in sheets.

## Textbooks

There is no course textbook.  However, the course content will draw from various sources.  We will cite the 
source when appropriate.  Please consult the resources page for additional information. 

## Assessment Procedure

Refer to the Coursework page for specific details on the grading scheme for the homeworks and groupwork policies The 
project page has a breakdown of the project.

**Course Grade Breakdown**
* Homework:  20%
* In-class Exercises:  20%
* Class participation:  10%
* Project: 50%

## Exams

We will not have standard midterm or final exams.  Instead, we will have a midterm presentation on project 
progress and a final project presentation during the scheduled final exam period.  Details on the project 
can be found on the project page.

## Prerequisites

Programming knowledge, **in Python** at the level of CS50 and CS 109 (or above). Besides this, you should 
have interest or investment in scientific computing.

## Academic Integrity

## Special Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability should contact me as soon as possible so that we can discuss arrangements 
to fit your needs.
