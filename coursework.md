## Course Format

The course consists of a mixture of lectures, homeworks, a midterm assessment, 
and a final project.  Lectures, lecture exercises, and most homeworks will be 
provided through Jupyter notebooks.  Details on each course component can be 
found below.  All course work will be hosted on your private GitHub repo.

## Lecture Format

The lectures will be available no earlier than 30 minutes before the class starts. 
You should sync your fork with the base repo either just before lecture or right 
when class begins.

* Lectures are held two times per week.
* Each lecture is 1.5 hours long.  
* A small portion of the lecture will involve me actually lecturing.  
* The rest of the time, students will be in small groups (~3 students) working on 
  programming exercises of increasing difficulty related to the topic of the day.

**Lecture Exercises**

Each lecture will consist of a few programming exercises.  Here's how we'll execute 
these exercises during lecture:

* The number of exercises will depend on the difficulty of each exercise.
* Students should initially work on the exercise individually. 
* I will announce when the individual working time is over.  **Don't worry if you 
  didn't complete the entire exercise on your own in the allotted time!** 
* After the individual working time ends, students will get together with their 
  group to compare answers and help each other out.
* Once the group collaboration time ends, one group will come to the front of 
  the class to present their solution.

**Students _must_ push their final solution to the exercises to their private repo 
  by 11:59 PM on the day of the lecture**

The teaching staff will grade selected exercises and check for completeness.  Since 
the correct solution is presented in class, these are almost free points.  Please 
complete the exercises!
