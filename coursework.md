## Course Format

The course consists of a mixture of lectures, homeworks, a midterm assessment, 
and a final project.  Lectures, lecture exercises, and most homeworks will be 
provided through Jupyter notebooks.  Details on each course component can be 
found below.  All course work will be hosted on your private GitHub repo.

## Course Workflow

All of your work will be hosted on your private GitHub repo.  It is critical 
that you set up a private repo (free for students) and give the teaching staff 
access.

Your directory structure should be as follows:

## Grading Scale 

Homework, lecture exercises and the final project will be graded on a 10 point scale: 

* 10 = Solid / no mistakes (or really minor ones)
* 8 = Good / some mistakes
* 6 = Fair / some major conceptual errors
* 4 = Poor / did not finish
* 2 = Very Poor / little to no attempt.
* 0 = Did not participate / did not hand in

## Lecture Format

The lectures will be available no earlier than 30 minutes before the class starts. 
You should sync your fork with the base repo either just before lecture or right 
when class begins.

* Lectures are held two times per week.
* Each lecture is 1.5 hours long.  
* A small portion of the lecture will involve me actually lecturing.  
* The rest of the time, students will be in small groups (~3 students) working on 
  programming exercises of increasing difficulty related to the topic of the day.

**Lecture Exercises**

Each lecture will consist of a few programming exercises.  Here's how we'll execute 
these exercises during lecture:

* The number of exercises will depend on the difficulty of each exercise.
* Students should initially work on the exercise individually. 
* I will announce when the individual working time is over.  **Don't worry if you 
  didn't complete the entire exercise on your own in the allotted time!** 
* After the individual working time ends, students will get together with their 
  group to compare answers and help each other out.
* Once the group collaboration time ends, one group will come to the front of 
  the class to present their solution.

**Students _must_ push their final solution to the exercises to their private repo 
  by 11:59 PM on the day of the lecture**

The teaching staff will grade selected exercises and check for completeness.  Since 
the correct solution is presented in class, these are almost free points.  Please 
complete the exercises!

## Homework

* Homework is worth 20% of your final grade.  
* Your private GitHub repo should contain a `homeworks` directory with 
  subdirectories for each homework assignment.
* Name the assignment that you want us to grade `HWn-final` where `n` is the 
  assignment number. **We will only grade appropriately-labeled assignments!**
* New homework will be assigned on Monday and due on Sunday night at **11:59 PM**.
* All assignments will involve programming.  
* Not all problems will be graded, but you should still do each problem 
  since you don't know which problems will be graded ahead of time.

**Homework Feed back:**

The teaching staff will provide feedback on your homework.  You will receive a 
pull request from the staff member who grades your assignment.  Once you approve 
and merge the pull request, you will be able to see your grade and associated 
comments.

**Homework rules:**

* Assignments must be completed individually
* Collaboration is permitted as long as discussions are limited to high-level 
  considerations.
  * For example, do not discuss implementation details
* Solutions _must_ be your own!

**Late Policy**

Late homework will not be accepted except in special cases.  Please contact me as 
soon as possible in the case of an unforeseen emergency or illness so we can figure 
out an approprate plan of action on a case by case basis.

## A Note on Groups

You will be assigned a group at the beginning of the semester.  The group will have 
3 or 4 members.  This is the group in which you will work on the in-class programming 
assignments.  It will also be your project group.
